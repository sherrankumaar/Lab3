# Lab3 - Program Control Statements 💻

This repository contains Java solutions for the Lab 3 assignment from Akademia Finansów i Biznesu Vistula. The tasks focus on program control statements including input/output operations, conditionals, loops, and switch statements.

## Tasks 📝

### Task 1: Simple Calculator ➕➖✖️➗
- Reads two float numbers from the user.
- Calculates the sum, difference, product, and quotient.
- Displays results formatted to two decimal places.

### Task 2: BMI Calculation 🏋️‍♂️📏
- Reads the user's weight and height.
- Calculates BMI using the formula:  
  `BMI = weight / (height^2)`
- Categorizes the BMI using an if-else-if ladder.

### Task 3: Quadratic Equation Solver ➗🧮
- Solves a quadratic equation `ax² + bx + c = 0`.
- Checks that coefficient `a` is not zero.
- Uses a switch statement based on the discriminant (delta) to determine and display the number of real roots.

### Task 4: Sum of Even Numbers (1 to 100) 🔢
- Uses a for loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 100.
- Sums and displays the even numbers.

### Task 5: Finding Biggest and Smallest Numbers 🔍
- Generates 10 random integers (1 to 100) using a while loop.
- Finds and displays the smallest and largest number without using arrays or collections.
